Project requirements

Overview
- Split-pane web app with a code editor on the left and an interactive task graph on the right.
- The editor defines tasks using a lightweight script syntax that is parsed into graph nodes.
- Keep this document updated whenever project behavior or UI changes.

Editor
- Fixed-width font with line numbers and syntax highlighting for tasks, subtasks, tags, people, and references.
- Indentation with Tab (indent) and Shift+Tab (unindent); Enter maintains current indentation.
- Undo/redo supported by the native textarea.
- Inline context suggestions for #tags, @people, and {task references}, navigable with arrows and accepted with Enter/Tab.

Task syntax
- A task starts with "* Task name" on its own line.
- Subtasks are indented by 4 spaces and use the same "*" syntax.
- Task descriptions follow task lines until a blank line; tags and people can appear anywhere inline in the description.
- Tags use #tag, people use @person, and references use {Task name}.
- Markdown in descriptions supports bold, italic, underline, highlight, lists, tables, images, and links.

Formatting syntax examples
- Bold: **bold**
- Italic: *italic*
- Underline: __underline__
- Highlight: ==highlight==
- List item: - item
- Checkbox: - [x] checked
- Table:
  | Col | Val |
  | --- | --- |
  | A | 1 |
- Image: ![alt](url)
- Link: [title](https://example.com)
- Task reference: {Task name}

Graph
- Right pane renders tasks and subtasks as a tree, connected by bezier lines.
- Nodes display the task title and render description markdown with inline pills for tags/people.
- Nodes can be collapsed/expanded; focus centers the selected task with animation.
- Pan and zoom supported on the graph canvas.

Tags & People
- Legend lists all tags and people; clicking toggles highlight filters.
- Clicking a tag/person pill in a node toggles the corresponding legend filter.
- When filters are active, non-matching tasks are dimmed and matching inline pills highlight.

Search
- Search input filters/highlights tasks by name, description, tags, or people with toggleable scope options.

Misc
- Clear Highlights resets all tag/person filters and search input.
- Clicking a task node focuses the corresponding editor line; moving the cursor in the editor updates focus in the graph.
